# Pyflowng postprocessing tools

A personal repository with codes to process the outputs of pyflowng (email andrew walker for more information) mainly for my publication on the memory of lowermost mantle anisotropy. 
It would be helpful to read or have the paper open when looking at some of these codes to help figure out what they do. Here are brief descriptions of what the codes do. 

* ani_percentiles.py - plots the cumulative histogram (percentile values) for the three ease-of-texturing case outputs. 
* box_plot_radial_ani.py - ignore this file. Was the beginnings of new plots. 
* compare_ani_parameters.py - produces scatter plots comparing the elastic tensor differential against model parameters such as temperature and other things like path length.
* particle_path_diff_map.py - plots a map of the difference in particle pathlength between two pyflowng runs. 
* plot_hists_rad_ani.py - plots the radial anisotropy distribution for the different ease of texturing cases. 
* plot_path_memory.py - 
* plot_timestep_testing.py - 
* residual_ani_maps.py - 
* residual_path_maps.py - 
* residual_tensor_map.py - 
* test_all_paths.sh - 
* test_pathline_memory.py -
